# Flatiron-Project-3
This project is about using statistical analysis techniques to determine the effects of discounting items in a toy dataset. The main technique used was t-testing the control group (no discounts) against each level of discount to determine the p-value and the effect size. 

Here is a sample of all the items in the database. They are all foods or beverages.

This is the distribution of prices.

As one can see, the items can be split into high- and low- cost sets. Theory is that cost is a confounding factor when applying discounts, however the null hypothesis could not be rejected.

Graphs are shown for quantities sold for the control group (no discount) versus all discount rates

This shows that there is a statistically significant difference for all discount levels, but the effect size is low to moderate. Recommendation is that discounts do not have a viable enough effect to be profitable.
