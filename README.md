# Flatiron-Project-3
This project is about using statistical analysis techniques to determine the effects of discounting items in a toy dataset. The main technique used was t-testing the control group (no discounts) against each level of discount to determine the p-value and the effect size. After that, insights are made in the notebook itself.
